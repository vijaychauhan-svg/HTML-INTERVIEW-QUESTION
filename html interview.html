    <h1>INTERVIEW QUESTION</h1>
    <p>-- Q1. How will you start a ordered list from 10? <br><br>

      Ans. As we know ordered list is a type of HTML lists to group a set a related items in lists 
      and it starts with (ol) tag and list item starts with the (li) tag.So, to start a list from 10
        or any other no.we use start atrribute: <br>
            (ol type="1" start="44")<br>
            (li)items(/li)<br>
            (li)items(/li)<br>
            (li)items(/li)<br>
            (li)items(/li)<br>
    </p>
    <div style="background-color: grey; padding: 10px;">
    
            <ol type="1" start="44">
            <li>items</li>
            <li>items</li>
            <li>items</li>
            <li>items</li> 

        </ol>
    </div>

           
       
    
        <p> Q2. What input type you will use to upload a image?<br><br>

          Ans. We use image tag to upload a image in a website or document .
          first,we download or save image from site or from your folder and then paste it in a
           current folder open in vs code.<br>
    
            EX: img src="./download.jpg" alt="random image" width="300" height="200"</p>
            <div style="background-color: lightgray;padding: 10px;">
                <img src="./download.jpg" alt="random image" width="300" height="200">

            </div>
           
          
<p> Q3.Name any 5 HTML5 tags?</p> <br>
    <div style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">
            Ans.    :(html)(/html)tag<br>
                    :(head)(/head)tag<br>
                    :(body)(/body)tag<br>
                    :(div)(/div)tag<br>
                    :(image)(/image)tag <br>
                    </div>
                    
                    

<p>Q4. What is DNS and when it comes into picture?<br><br>
    

 Ans. A.DNS stands for Domain Name System.<br>

      B.It works like the phonebook of the internet.<br>

      C.Every website is hosted on a server that has an IP address (like 192.168.1.1 or 2001:db8::1).<br>

      D.Humans find it hard to remember these numbers, so we use domain names like google.com or youtube.com.<br>

      E.DNS translates these human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.<br>

Example:<br>
When you type www.google.com in your browser:<br>

DNS translates www.google.com → 142.250.183.164 (an IP).<br>

Your browser then connects to that IP to load Google’s website.<br>

2.DNS comes into play whenever you try to access a website or service using a domain name.<br><br>

Steps (simplified):<br>

A.You type a domain name (e.g., openai.com) in your browser.<br>

B.Your computer asks the DNS resolver (usually your ISP or a configured DNS like Google DNS 8.8.8.8) for the IP address.<br>

C.The DNS resolver checks its cache; if not found, it queries root servers → TLD servers (.com, .org, etc.) → authoritative DNS servers.<br>

D.It finds the IP address of openai.com.<br>

E.Your browser uses that IP to request the webpage.
        </P>

<p>-- Q5. What is Markup? <br><BR>
    
    
  Ans. Markup means symbols, tags, or codes added to text to tell a computer how that text should be displayed or structured.<BR>

1.It doesn’t change the actual content (the words), but it tells the browser/software what the content means and how to present it.

  Examples of Markup: <BR>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)<BR>

Used for web pages.<br>

Example:<BR>


(H3) Hello World (/H3)<br>
<div style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; padding: 5px;">
<h3>Hello World</h3><BR></div>
 (p) This is a paragraph (/p)   
<p>This is a paragraph.</p><BR>
Here:
(h1) tells the browser this is a heading.<BR>
(p)tells the browser this is a paragraph.<BR><br>

 #.XML (eXtensible Markup Language):-<BR>

. Used to store and transport data with meaning.<BR>
Example:<BR>
(person)
  (name)Vijay(/name)<BR>
  (age)25(/age)<BR>
(/person)

  </P>
  <div style="background-color: yellowgreen;padding: 10px;">
    <person>
  <name>Vijay</name>
  <age>25</age>
  </person>
  </div>

    </P>

<P>
Q8. EXPLAIN WHAT IS WEB DESIGNING?<BR><BR>

ANS.Webpage designing (often called web design) is the process of planning, creating, and arranging content on a web page so that it is visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional when viewed in a web browser.<BR>

It involves a mix of creativity (visual look) and technical knowledge (coding and structure).<BR><BR>

🔹 Key Points of Webpage Designing:<BR><BR>

1.Layout & Structure:-<BR>

A.Organizing elements like headers, menus, sections, sidebars, and footers.<BR>

B.Deciding how text, images, videos, and links are arranged.<BR><BR>

2.Visual Design:-<BR>

A.Choosing colors, fonts, images, icons, and spacing.<BR>

B.Following design principles like balance, contrast, and consistency.<BR>

3.User Experience (UX):-<BR><BR>

6.Web Technologies Used:-<BR>

A.HTML → structure of the page<BR>

B.CSS → styling and appearance<BR>

C.JavaScript → interactivity and dynamic behavior<BR>
</P>

<P>
    Q9.HOW WILL YOU OPEN ANOTHER WINDOW USING ANCHOR TAG?<BR><BR>
    ANS.In HTML, you can open another window (or tab) using the target attribute of the <a> (anchor) tag.<BR><BR>

✅ Code Example:<BR>
    (a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank")Open Google(/a)<BR>
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Open Google</a><BR>

🔹 Explanation of target attribute values:<BR><BR>

_blank → Opens the link in a new window/tab (most browsers open in a new tab).<BR>

_self → Opens in the same window (default behavior).<BR>

_parent → Opens in the parent frame (if using frames).<BR>

_top → Opens in the full body of the window, breaking out of frames. <BR>   
</P>

<P>
    Q10.WHAT DOES VIEWPORT META TAG DO?<BR><BR>
    ANS.The viewport meta tag in HTML is used to control how a web page is displayed on mobile devices and tablets.<BR>
        The viewport meta tag tells the browser how to scale and size the page to match the actual device screen.<BR>
          <DIV style="background-color: rgb(94, 114, 139);" >
          Example:<BR>
 (meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")<BR>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"><BR>
  </DIV>

Explanation:<BR><BR>


A.width=device-width → Sets the page width equal to the device’s screen width.<BR>

B.initial-scale=1.0 → Sets the initial zoom level (1 means no zoom).<BR>

C.maximum-scale and minimum-scale → Control how much users can zoom in or out.<BR>

D.user-scalable=no → Prevents users from zooming (not recommended for accessibility).<BR><BR>

1.Without viewport meta tag:<BR>

A.The page might shrink to fit a large "virtual" desktop layout.<BR>

B.Text looks tiny, requiring zoom to read.<BR><BR>

2.With viewport meta tag:<BR>

A.The page adapts to the device screen size (responsive design).<BR>

B.Text and elements appear at a readable size automatically. <BR>      
</P>
<p>
  Q10. What are Attributes in HTML?<br><br>
  Ans.In HTML, attributes are extra pieces of information added to an element to define its properties, behavior, or appearance.<br>

Attributes always appear inside the opening tag of an element and are written as a name–value pair:<br><br>

(tagname attribute="value")Content(/tagname)<br>
<tagname attribute="value">Content</tagname><br>

Key Points about Attributes:<br><br>

A.Always in opening tag – never in closing tag.<br>

B.Provide additional information about an element.<br>

C.Usually come in name/value pairs like name="value".<br>

D.Values are written inside double quotes (best practice).<br><br>

Example:<br>
<div  style="background-color: lightskyblue; padding: 5px;">
(a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank")Visit Google(/a)<br>

<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Visit Google</a><br>
</div>


href="https://www.google.com" → attribute that defines the link’s destination.<br><br>

target="_blank" → attribute that opens the link in a new tab.<br>

Common HTML Attributes:<br>

A.id → unique identifier for an element.<br>

B.class → assign one or more CSS classes.<br>

C.src → source of an image, video, or script.<br>

D.alt → alternate text for an image.<br>

E.style → apply inline CSS.<br>

F.title → tooltip text shown on hover.<br>

G.disabled → makes input/button unclickable.<br>
</p>
<p>
 Q12. What is dns?<br><br>
 Ans.DNS stands for Domain Name System.<BR>
>   It works like the phonebook of the internet.<BR>

When you type a website address (like www.google.com) in your browser:<BR><BR>

1.The browser doesn’t understand names; it needs an IP address (like 142.250.193.78) to connect to the correct server.<BR>

2.DNS translates the domain name into its IP address, so your browser can reach the website.<BR>
 <DIV style="background-color: lightgreen;" >
Example:<BR>
 

>You type: www.facebook.com<BR>

>DNS translates it to: 157.240.229.35<BR>

>Browser connects to that server and loads Facebook.<BR><BR>
  </DIV>

Why DNS is important:<BR>

A.Makes browsing easier (you don’t need to remember numbers, just names).<BR>

B.Works like a directory that keeps updating automatically.<BR>

C.Without DNS, you would have to type IP addresses for every site.<BR>
</p>
<p>
 Q13.what is ip address?<br><br>
 Ans.An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each device (computer, phone, server, etc.) connected to a network (like the internet).<BR>

It works like a home address, but for devices on the internet — it tells other devices where to find you and how to send information.<BR>

Types of IP Addresses:-<BR>

1.IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)<BR>

Format: 192.168.1.1 (4 sets of numbers, each 0–255).<BR>
  <DIV style="background-color: aquamarine;" >

Example: 142.250.193.78 (used by Google servers).

About 4.3 billion unique addresses.<BR>
  </DIV>

2.IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)<BR>

Format: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334<BR>

Created because IPv4 addresses are running out.<BR>

Allows trillions of addresses.<BR><BR>

Two Main Uses:<BR>

>Identifying the device on a network.<BR>

>Locating the device so data can be sent to the correct destination.<BR><BR>
   <DIV style="background-color: rgb(183, 201, 195);" >

Example:<BR>

A.When you visit www.google.com, your computer:<BR>

B.Uses DNS to find Google’s IP address.<BR>

C.Connects to that IP address.<BR>

D.Receives the web page data back. <BR>
  </DIV>
</p>
<p>
 Q.14 what is localhost?<br><br>
 Ans.Localhost is a special hostname that always refers to your own computer (the machine you are currently using).<br> 

In networking, localhost maps to the IP address 127.0.0.1 (IPv4) or ::1 (IPv6).<br> 

It is mainly used for testing and development because it allows you to run websites, apps, or servers locally without needing internet access.<br> <br> 

<div style="background-color: lightgray;" >
Example:<br> 

If you type in your browser:<br> 

http://localhost<br> 


or

http://127.0.0.1<br> 
</div>


→ your browser will try to connect to a server running on your own computer.<br> 

If you have a local server (like XAMPP, WAMP, Node.js, or Python server) running, it will show your project/website.<br> <br> 

Why Localhost is useful:<br> 

A.Web development → You can build and test a website before publishing it online.<br> 

B.Software testing → Apps can be checked locally without affecting the internet.<br> 

C.Networking checks → Developers use it to ensure services are running properly.<br>

 Q.15 HTML5 vs HTML4:-<BR><BR>
 Ans. A.HTML4: Released in 1997, it was the standard for many years but had limitations for modern web apps.<br>

      B.HTML5: Introduced in 2014 (finalized), designed to support modern multimedia, mobile devices, and interactive content.<br><br>
 
 1. Doctype:-<BR>

In HTML4, the doctype declaration was very long and complicated.<BR>

In HTML5, it is very short and simple: <!DOCTYPE html>.<BR><BR>

🔹 2. Multimedia:-<BR>

HTML4 could not play audio or video directly; you needed plugins like Flash.<BR>

HTML5 has built-in audio and video tags to play media without plugins.<BR><BR>

🔹 3. Graphics and Animations:-<BR>

HTML4 relied on Flash or other external tools for graphics.<BR>

HTML5 provides canvas and svg for drawing and animations directly in the browser.<BR><BR>

🔹 4. Semantic Elements:-<BR>

HTML4 used only generic tags like div and span for structure.<BR>

HTML5 introduced meaningful tags such as header, footer, article, section, and nav to make code more understandable.<BR><BR>

🔹 5. Forms:-<BR>

HTML4 supported only basic input types such as text, password, and checkbox.<BR>

HTML5 added new input types like email, date, number, url, range, and search.<BR><BR>

🔹 6. APIs and Features:-<BR>

HTML4 had no built-in APIs.<BR>

HTML5 includes many APIs like Geolocation, Local Storage, Offline Web Apps, Drag & Drop, and WebSockets.<BR><BR>

🔹 7. Storage:-<BR>

HTML4 used cookies to store data, which had limited capacity and were less secure.<BR>

HTML5 introduced localStorage and sessionStorage for larger, safer, and faster data storage.<BR><BR>

🔹 8. Mobile Support:-<BR>

HTML4 was not designed for mobile devices.<BR>

HTML5 is mobile-friendly, supports responsive design, and works well with modern devices. <BR> 
</P>
<P>
 Q16.what are semantic tags?<BR><BR>
 Ans. Semantic tags in HTML are tags that have a clear, meaningful purpose — they describe the role of the content inside them, rather than just how it looks.<br>

In simple words:<br>

A semantic tag tells both the browser and the developer what that part of the webpage means.<br>

A non-semantic tag (like div and span) only tells "this is a container," without any meaning.<br>

🔹 Examples of Semantic Tags (introduced in HTML5):<br>

A.header → Defines the top section of a page or article (like a heading, logo, nav).<br>

B.footer → Defines the bottom section (copyright, links, contact info).<br>

C.nav → Contains navigation links (menus, bars).<br>

D.article → Represents an independent piece of content (like a blog post or news article).<br>

E.section → Defines a thematic group of content (chapters, parts of a page).<br>

F.aside → Side content, like a sidebar or ads.<br>

G.main → Represents the main content of the page.<br>

H.figure and figcaption → For images, charts, or diagrams with captions.<br><br>


</p>

<p>
 Q17.what are the new features in HTML5?<br><br>

</p>

<p>
  Q18.Difference between div and span:- <br><br>
  Ans.The difference between div and span in HTML is primarily about how they are displayed and their semantic purpose. Here's a detailed breakdown:<br>

1. Display Type:-<br><br>
A.Display:-<br>
>Div- Block-level element.<br>
>span-	Inline element.<br><br>
B.Effect:-<br>
> Div (Starts on a new line; can contain other block or inline elements).<br>
>Span (Stays on the same line; can only contain inline elements).<br><br>
<div style="background-color: aqua;">

Example:

(/div)This is a div(/div)

</div><BR><BR>






2. Purpose / Semantic Usage:-<BR>

A.div: Used to group larger sections or blocks of content (like headers, sections, footers).<BR>

B.span: Used to style or target small portions of text or inline content without breaking the line structure.<BR><BR>

3. Common Use:-<BR>

A.div: Layout, page structure, container for multiple elements.<BR>

B.span: Apply styles (like color, font) to a specific part of text or inline content.<BR><BR>

Example:<BR>
  <DIV style="background-color: lightgray;">

div<BR>
  (h2)Title(/h2)<BR>
  (p)This is a paragraph inside a div.(/p)<BR>
/div<BR>
<div>
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>


(p)This is a (span style="color:red;")red(/span) word in a sentence.(/p)<BR>
  <p>This is a <span style="color:red;">red</span> word in a sentence.</p>
  </DIV>
<BR>
4. CSS & JavaScript:-<BR>

Both can be styled with CSS and accessed via JavaScript, but div is better for structural grouping, span is better for inline styling.<BR>

Summary:<BR>

div = block-level, used for layout and grouping large content.<BR>

span = inline, used for styling or modifying small parts of content.<BR>
</p>
<p>
  Q19.Difference between class and IDs:-<BR><BR>
  Ans.1. Uniqueness:-<BR>

A.ID (id): Must be unique within a page. You should only use a particular ID on one element.<BR>

 Q20. What are self closing tags?<BR><BR>
 Ans.Self-closing tags in HTML are tags that do not need a separate closing tag because they don’t wrap any content. Instead, they “close themselves” in the opening tag.<BR>

Key Points:<BR>

>They are also called void elements.<BR>

>They cannot have content inside.<BR>

>In HTML5, you can write them as tag or tag /. The slash (/) at the end is optional in HTML5 but required in XHTML.<BR>

Common Examples of Self-Closing Tags:<BR>

A.img – Inserts an image.<BR>

B.br – Inserts a line break.<BR>

C.hr – Inserts a horizontal line.<BR>

D.input – Form input fields.<BR>

E.meta – Metadata inside <head>.<BR>

F.link – Links to external resources like CSS.<BR>

G.source – Specifies media source for audio/video.<BR>
  <div style="background-color: lightgreen;">

Example in HTML:<BR>
(img src="photo.jpg" alt="My Photo")
<br>
(input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name")<BR>
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="My Photo">
<br>
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
</div>
</p>
<p>
 Q21.How many types of headings are der ?How to decide which to use where?<BR><BR>
 Ans.In HTML, there are 6 types of headings, ranging from h1 to h6. They are used to define headings and subheadings on a webpage, and they also convey the hierarchy and importance of content.<BR>

Types of Headings:-<BR>

>h1 – Main heading, most important. Usually only one per page.<BR>

>h2 – Subheading of h1.<BR>

>h3– Subheading of h2.<BR>

>h4 – Subheading of h3.<BR>

>h5 – Subheading of h4.<BR>

>h6 – Least important heading, subheading of h5.<BR>

How to Decide Which Heading to :-<BR><BR>

1.Hierarchy Matters:<BR>

A.h1 → The main topic/title of the page.<BR>

B.h2 → Major sections under h1.<BR>

C.h3 → Subsections under h2, and so on.<BR><BR>

2.SEO & Accessibility:<BR>

A.Search engines use headings to understand page structure.<BR>

B.Screen readers use headings to help users navigate the page.<BR><BR>

3.Clarity for Users:<BR>

A.Don’t skip heading levels randomly. Keep a logical order: h1→ h2 →h3.<BR>

B.Use h4–h6 for minor subheadings or less important content. <BR>
</p>
<p>
 Q22.Difference between block and inline:- <br><br>
 Ans.Display Behavior:-<br>

A.Block elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available.<br>

B.Inline elements stay on the same line as surrounding content and take up only as much width as needed.<br><br>

2. Content Containment:-<br>

A.Block elements can contain both block and inline elements.<br>

B.Inline elements can only contain other inline elements or text.<br><br>

3. Examples:<br>

>Block elements: (div), (p), (h1)–(h6), (section), (article)<br>

>Inline elements: (span), (a), (strong), (em), (img)<br><br>

4. Styling & Layout:-<br>

A.Block elements can have width, height, margin, and padding applied in all directions.<br>

BB.Inline elements cannot have top and bottom margin or height applied; width is generally determined by the content.<br><br>

5. Use Case:-<br>

A.Block elements are used for structural layout (like sections, paragraphs, divs).<br>

B.Inline elements are used for styling or modifying small pieces of content within a block (like coloring a word, linking text).<br>

</p>
<p>
 Q23.Difference between em and strong:- <br><br>
 Ans.Here’s the difference between (em) and (strong) in HTML explained clearly:<br>

1. Purpose / Meaning:-<br>

(A) em (emphasis):<br>
Used to indicate emphasized text. It suggests that the text should be stressed or spoken with emphasis.<br>

(B) strong (strong importance):<br>
Used to indicate strong importance or seriousness. The text is considered important rather than just emphasized.<br><br>

2. Default Rendering:-<br>

A.(em) usually appears as italic in most browsers.<br>

B.(strong) usually appears as bold in most browsers.<br>

Note: This is only default styling; the real purpose is semantic, not visual. You can style them with CSS however you like.<br><br>

3. Accessibility / Screen Readers:-<br>

Screen readers emphasize (em) text by changing intonation.<br>

Screen readers stress (strong) text by giving it more importance in the reading.<br><br>

4. Use Case:-<br>

A.(em) → “I really like this idea.” (emphasize a word or phrase)<br>

B.(strong) → “It is very important to submit the form.” (highlight important information)<br>

</p>
<p>
 Q24.What are attributes?<br><br>
 Ans.In HTML, attributes are extra pieces of information that provide more details about an element. They are always written inside the opening tag of an element and usually come in name="value" format.<br>

Key Points About Attributes:-<br>

Provide additional information: Attributes describe how an element should behave or display.<br>

Written inside the opening tag: For example, (tag attribute="value").<br>

Most elements can have multiple attributes.<br>

Some attributes are required, others are optional.<br><br>

Common Examples of Attributes:-<br>

id → Gives a unique identifier to an element.<br>

(div id="header")Welcome(/div)<br>

(div id="header")Welcome(/div)<br>


class → Groups elements for styling or scripting.<br>

(p class="highlight")This is important text.</p><br>

(p class="highlight")This is important text.</p><br>


src → Specifies the source of an image or media.<br>

img src="photo.jpg" alt="My Photo"<br>
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="My Photo"><br>


alt → Provides alternative text for an image.<br>

href → Specifies the URL in a link. <br>
</p>
<p>
 Q25.Difference between HTML tags and elements:- <BR><BR>
 Ans.Here’s the difference between HTML tags and HTML elements explained clearly:<BR>

1. HTML Tags:-<BR>

Definition: Tags are the markup codes used to define the start or end of an element in HTML.<BR>

Purpose: They tell the browser where an element begins and ends.<BR>

Syntax: Tags are written inside angle brackets.<BR>

Opening tag: (p)<BR>

Closing tag: (/p)<BR>

Self-closing tag: (img /)<BR>

Example:<BR>

(p)This is a paragraph.(/p)<BR>


Here, (p) and (/p) are the tags.<BR>

2. HTML Elements:-<BR>

Definition: An element is the complete structure consisting of the opening tag, content, and closing tag.<BR>

Purpose: Elements are the actual building blocks of a webpage that define content and structure.<BR>

Includes: Tags + content (for non-self-closing elements)<BR>

Example:<BR>

(p)This is a paragraph.(/p)<BR>


Here, (p)This is a paragraph.(/p) is the HTML element.<BR>
  <div style="background-color: lightgrey;">

For self-closing elements like (img src="photo.jpg" alt="Photo"), the tag and element are effectively the same, because there is no separate closing tag or inner content.<BR>
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Photo">
</div>
</p>
<p>
 Q26.Explain br tags?<BR><bR>
 Ans.The (br) tag in HTML is used to insert a line break within text, meaning the content following it will start on a new line.<bR>

Key Points About (br)<bR>

Self-closing tag:<bR>

(br) does not have a closing tag.<bR>

In XHTML, it is written as (br /), but in HTML5, br is sufficient.<bR>

Inline element:<bR>

It is an inline element, so it doesn’t create extra space like a block element does.<bR>

Purpose:<bR>

Used to break lines inside paragraphs, addresses, poems, or any text where a new line is needed without starting a new paragraph.<bR>
<DIV style="background-color: lightgreen;">
Example:-<bR>
(p)
This is the first line.<br>
This is the second line.<br>
This is the third line.
(/p)<BR>
   <p>
  
This is the first line.<br>
This is the second line.<br>
This is the third line.
</p> 
</DIV>

</fieldset>   
</p>
<p>
Q36.What are some common lists that are used when designing a page?<br><br>
Ans.In HTML, lists are commonly used to organize content on a webpage. There are three main types of lists:<br><br>

1. Ordered List (ol):-<br>

Displays items in a specific order, usually numbered.<br>
<fieldset>
    <pre>
        Syntax:<br>

(ol)<br>
  (li)First item(/li)<br>
  (li)Second item(/li)<br>
  (li)Third item(/li)<br>
(/ol)<br>


Example output:<Br>

First item<br>

Second item<br>

Third item<br>
    </pre>
</fieldset>



You can also change numbering type using the type attribute:<br>

(ol type="A") <!-- A, B, C... --><br><br>

2. Unordered List (ul):-<br>

Displays items without any specific order, usually with bullets.<br>
<fieldset>
    <pre>
Syntax:<br>

ul
  (li)Item 1(/li)<br>
  (li)Item 2(/li)<br>
  (li)Item 3(/li)<br>
(/ul)<br>


Example output:<br>

Item 1<br>

Item 2<br>

Item 3<br>
    </pre>
</fieldset>



Bullet style can be changed using the type attribute (circle, square, disc).<br><br>

3. Definition List (dl):-<br>

Used for terms and their definitions.<br>
<fieldset>
    <pre>
Syntax:<br>

</fieldset>


</p>

<p>
Q37.Write a structure of definition list.<br><br>
Ans.A definition list in HTML is used to display terms and their descriptions. It uses three main tags:<br>

1.dl → defines the definition list<br>

2.dt→ defines the term<br>

3.dd → defines the description of the term<br><br>
 <fieldset>
<Pre>
Basic Structure:<br>
(dl)<br>
  (dt)HTML(/dt)<br>
  (dd)Hypertext Markup Language(/dd)<br><br>

  (dt)CSS(/dt)<br>
  (dd)Cascading Style Sheets(/dd)<br><br>

  (dt)JavaScript(/dt)<br>
  (dd)A programming language for the web</dd><br>
(/dl)
</Pre>
</fieldset>

<br>
Explanation:<br>

A.(dl) wraps the whole list.<br>

B.(dt) contains the term you want to define.<br>

C.(dd) contains the definition of that term.<br>    
</p>

<P>
Q38.What does mean by of dl, dt and dd in definition list.<BR><BR>
Ans.In an HTML definition list, the tags (dl), (dt), and (dd) have specific meanings and roles:<br>


A.(dl):-It wraps the entire list of terms and their definitions. It acts as the container for the list.<br>
B.(dt):-Represents the term or name being defined.<br>
c.(dd):-Represents the description, meaning, or definition of the term specified in (dt).

Q39.What is an image map?<br><br>
Ans.An image map in HTML is an image that has clickable areas, where each area can link to a different destination (URL, page section, etc.).<br>

It allows you to define multiple hyperlinks within a single image by specifying hotspot regions (rectangles, circles, or polygons) on the image.<br>

Main Tags Used:<br>

1.(img) → Displays the image.<br>

2.usemap → Attribute of (img) that links the image to a map.<br>

3.(map) → Defines the image map (a collection of clickable areas).<br>

4.(area) → Defines each clickable area (shape and link). <br>   
</p>

<p>
Q40.How to insert a copyright symbol on a browser page?<br><br>

<p>
Q41.How to create a nested webpage in HTML?<br><br>
Ans.A nested webpage in HTML usually means displaying one webpage inside another webpage. This is done using the (iframe) tag (inline frame).<br>

<div style="background-color: lightgray;">
Basic Syntax of iframe:<br>

(iframe src="page2.html" width="600" height="400")(/iframe)<br>

<iframe src="page2.html" width="600" height="400"></iframe><br>
</div>

src → specifies the file or URL of the nested webpage.<br>

width & height → control the size of the frame.<br>

Example: Create a Nested Webpage

Suppose you have two files:<br>

1. page1.html (main page):-<br>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Main Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Main Page</h1>
  <p>Below is a nested webpage:</p>

  <!-- Nested Page (page2.html) inside -->
  <iframe src="page2.html" width="500" height="300"></iframe>
</body>
</html>


2. page2.html (nested page):=<br>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Nested Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Hello! I am a Nested Webpage</h2>
  <p>This page is displayed inside the main page using an iframe.</p>
</body>
</html>
   </p> 
   <p>
     Q42.Does a hyperlink only apply to text?<br><br>   
     No — a hyperlink does not only apply to text.<br>
In HTML, a hyperlink (a tag) can be applied to any element, such as:<br>

1. Hyperlink on Text (most common):<br>
<a href="https://www.prepbytes.com">Go to Prepbytes</a>

2. Hyperlink on an Image:<br>
<a href="https://www.prepbytes.com">
  <img src="logo.png" alt="Prepbytes Logo" width="200">
</a>

 3. Hyperlink on a Button (using button inside a):<br>
<a href="https://www.prepbytes.com">
  <button>Visit Prepbytes</button>
</a>

4. Hyperlink on an Icon / Shape (using CSS or SVG):<br>
<a href="https://www.prepbytes.com">
  <i></i>
</a>


So, a hyperlink (a) can wrap around text, images, buttons, icons, or even entire div sections — anything you put inside becomes clickable.<br>
</p>
<p>  
Q43.What is a style sheet?<br><br>
     A style sheet is a file or a block of code that defines how the elements of an HTML page should look.<br>
It controls the presentation layer (design/appearance) of a webpage, such as:<br>

>Fonts (size, color, family)<br>

>Text alignment<br>

>Background colors and images<br>

>Layout (margins, padding, positioning)<br>

>Borders, buttons, hover effects, etc.<br>

Types of Style Sheets in HTML:-<br>

A.Inline Style Sheet:<br>

Styles are written directly inside the HTML element using the style attribute.<br>

<h1 style="color: red; text-align: center;">Hello World</h1><br>


B.Internal Style Sheet:-<br>

Styles are written inside the (style) tag in the (head) section of an HTML document.<br>

<html>
<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: blue;
      text-align: center;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>


C.External Style Sheet (most common & professional way):<br>

Styles are written in a separate .css file and linked using (link).<br>


<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
<br>
/* style.css */
h1 {
  color: green;
  text-align: center;
}   

    
   
    </p>


<p>
Q44. Can you create a multi coloured text on a web page?<br><br>
Yes, you can create multi-colored text on a webpage using HTML + CSS.<br>
There are different ways to do it depending on the effect you want.<br>

1. Different colors for each word/letter (using span)<br>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Multi-colored Text</title>
</head>

 Q45.Is it possible to change the color of the bullet?<br><br>
 Ans.Yes, it is possible to change the color of bullets in an HTML list, but not directly with the color property because that only changes the text color, not the bullet itself.<br>

Here are some ways to do it:<br>
 1. Change bullet color along with text (simple way)<br>

If you just apply color to the list item, both text and bullet will change:<br>
<fieldset>
  <pre>
    ul style="color: red;"
  (li)Apple(/li)
  (li)Banana(/li)
  (li)Cherry(/li)
(/ul)
  </pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

Output:<br>
<ul style="color: red;">
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
  <li>Cherry</li>
</ul>
<br>

Here, both bullets and text are red. 
</p>
<p>
 Q46. Explain the layout of HTML?<br><br>
 Ans.Basic HTML Layout:-<br>

A standard webpage layout is usually divided into the following parts:<br>

A.Header (header):-<br>

1.Appears at the top of the page.<br>

2.Usually contains logo, website name, navigation menu.<br>

B.Navigation (nav):-<br>

>Contains links (hyperlinks) to other sections/pages.<br>

C.Main Content (main):-<br>

>The central part of the page where the actual content (text, images, videos) is displayed.<br>

D.Sidebar (aside):-<br>

>.A side section used for ads, links, additional info, widgets.<br>

E.Footer (footer):-<br>

>.Appears at the bottom of the page.<br>

>.Contains copyright info, contact details, social media links.<br>
</p>
<p>
 Q47.What is a marquee?<br><br>
 Ans.A marquee is an HTML tag (marquee) that was used to create scrolling text or images across the webpage, either horizontally or vertically.<br>

Example: Moving announcements, news tickers, or banners.<br>

Basic Syntax:-<br>
<marquee bgcolor="yellow">HELLO WORLD</marquee>


<br>
This will make the text scroll horizontally from right to left by default.
</p>
<p>
 Q48.How to make a picture of a background image of a web page?<br><br>

 Using CSS background-image:-<br>
Example: Full-page background image<br>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      background-image: url("./download\ \(1\).jpg");  
      background-repeat: no-repeat;            
      background-size: cover;                 
      background-position: center;           
      background-attachment: fixed;           
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Welcome to My Website</h1>
</body>
</html> 
</p>
<p>
 Q49.How many tags can be used to separate a section of texts?<br><br>
 Ans.In HTML, several tags can be used to separate or divide sections of text. The choice depends on what kind of separation you want:

Tags to Separate Text Sections:-<br>

A. (P) (Paragraph tag):-<br>

Used to separate text into paragraphs.

<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>


B.(br) (Line Break tag)<br>

Inserts a single line break (no extra spacing like p).<br>

First line(br)
Second line


C.(hr) (Horizontal Rule):-<br>

Creates a horizontal line to visually separate sections.<br>

<p>Introduction</p>
<hr>
<p>Conclusion</p>


D.Sectioning Tags (Semantic HTML5):-<br>
These divide a page into meaningful sections:<br>
(div) → Generic container (commonly used for layout/design).<br>

1.(header) → Defines top section (logo, title, nav).<br>

2.(nav) → Navigation links.<br>

3.(section) → Groups related content.<br>

4.(article) → Self-contained content (like a blog post).<br>

5.(aside) → Sidebar content.<br>

6.(footer) → Bottom section.<br>
<fieldset>
  <pre>
<section>
  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Some info about our company.</p>
</section> 
  </pre>
</fieldset>

</p>
<p>
 Q50.What are empty elements?<br><br>
 Ans.>An empty element is an HTML element that does not have any content or closing tag.<br>
     >It only has a start tag (opening tag) and no end tag.<br>

     >These elements are also called void elements or self-closing elements.<br>

Examples of Empty Elements:-<br>

1.(br) → Inserts a line break<br>

Hello<br>World


2.(hr) → Inserts a horizontal line (rule):-<br>

<hr>


3.<img> → Embeds an image:-<br>

<img src="./download (2).jpg" alt="My Photo"> 
</p>
<p>
 Q51.What is the use of a span tag? Give one example.<br><br>
 Ans. The (span) tag is an inline container used to apply styles or manipulate a part of text without affecting the layout.<br>

It does not create a new line (unlike div), so it’s ideal for styling small portions of text within a paragraph or heading.<br>

Key Points:-<br>

A.Inline element<br>

B.No visual change by default<br>

C.Often used with CSS or JavaScript<br>

Example: Coloring a part of text<Br>
<p>
  This is a <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">highlighted text</span> inside a paragraph.
</p> 
  </p>

  <p>
  Q52.What is the use of an iframe tag?<br><br>
  Ans.The iframe (Inline Frame) tag in HTML is used to embed another webpage or content inside the current webpage.<br>

It essentially creates a window within a page that can display another HTML page, a video, a map, or any external content.<br><br>

Key Uses of (iframe):-<br>

A.Embed external websites within your page.<br>

B.Show videos (like YouTube) without redirecting.<br>

C.Display maps (like Google Maps).<br>

D.Embed documents (PDF, HTML, etc.) in a page.  <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  Q53.What are the entities in HTML?<br><br>
  Ans.>HTML entities are special codes used to display reserved characters or symbols in HTML that would otherwise be interpreted as part of the HTML code.<br>

      >They allow you to display special characters, symbols, or invisible characters safely on a webpage.  <br>

  </p>
  <p>
    Q54.Why is a URL encoded in HTML?<br><br>
    Ans.A URL is encoded in HTML to ensure that it can be safely transmitted and correctly interpreted by browsers and servers.<br>

Key Reasons for URL Encoding:-<br>

1.Special Characters in URLs<br>

.URLs can only contain letters, digits, and a few special characters.<br>

.Characters like spaces, <, >, #, %, and & cannot be used directly because they have special meanings in URLs or HTML.<br>

.Encoding replaces them with a percent (%) followed by hexadecimal code.<br>
  </p>
   <p>
   Q55.Does a <!DOCTYPE html> tag is a HTML tag?<br><Br>
   Ans.No, <!DOCTYPE html> is not an HTML tag.<br>
   A.It is a declaration, called the Document Type Declaration (DTD).<br>

B.It tells the browser which version of HTML the document is written in.<br>

C.In modern HTML5, it tells the browser to render the page in standards mode. <br> 
   </p>
   <p>
    Q56.What is the canvas element in HTML5?<br><Br>
    Ans.The (canvas) element is a container for graphics in HTML5. It allows you to draw shapes, graphics, animations, and images dynamically using JavaScript.<br>

By itself, (canvas) does not display anything until you use JavaScript to draw on it.<br>

It is often used for:<br>

A.Charts and graphs<br>

B.Games<br>

C.Animations<br>

D.Interactive graphics<br>

Basic Syntax(canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="300")(/canvas)


>id → Identifier to access the canvas with JavaScript

>width / height → Size of the canvas (default is 300×150)  
   </p>
   <p>
   Q57.What is SVG?<br><br>
   Ans. >SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.<br>
       >It is an XML-based format used to create vector images directly in HTML.<br>

Key Points:-<br>

A.Vector graphics → SVG uses lines, shapes, and paths instead of pixels.<br>

B.This means images are scalable without losing quality.<br>

C.XML-based → You can write SVG code directly in HTML.<br>

D.Interactive and Animatable → SVG elements can be styled with CSS and manipulated with JavaScript. <br>
   </p>
   <p>
    Q58.What are the different new form element types in HTML 5?<br><br>
    Ans.HTML5 introduced several new form input types to make form handling easier, more semantic, and interactive. These enhance user experience and allow the browser to provide validation automatically.<br>
    New Form Element Types in HTML5:-<br>
    A.email:-Accepts email addresses. Browser validates format automatically.
    <br> <input type="email" placeholder="Enter email"><br>
    B.URL:-Accepts URLs. Browser validates format.<br>
     <input type="url" placeholder="https://example.com"><br>

  </p>
<p>
 Q59.Is there any need to change the web browsers to support HTML5<br><br>

C.Multimedia (audio, video)<br>

D.Canvas (canvas)<br>

E.SVG graphics<br>

F.New form input types (email, date, color, etc.)<br>

2.Older Browsers (like IE8, IE9):-<br>

A.Some HTML5 features may not work correctly in very old browsers.<br>

B.Developers used polyfills or fallbacks to handle these cases.<br>

3.No Need to Change the Browser:-<br>

A.If your browser is reasonably up-to-date (last 5–6 years), it supports almost all HTML5 features.<br>

B.Only very old versions may require updates. <br>
</p>
<p>
 Q60.Which type of video formats are supported by HTML5?<br><br>
 Ans.HTML5 (video) tag can play videos directly in the browser without any plugins, but browser support varies by format. The most commonly supported formats are:<br> 
Example:-<br>
MP4 (H.264 + AAC):-<br>

a.Extension: .mp4<br>

b.Supported by: Almost all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera)<br>

c.Pros: Best compatibility, widely used<br>
<Fieldset>
  <pre>
    (video width="320" height="240" controls)
  (source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4")
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
(/video)
  </pre>
</Fieldset>


</p>
<p>
 Q61.Is audio tag supported in HTML 5?<br><br>
 Ans.Yes , the <audio> tag is supported in HTML5.<br>

It is used to embed audio content (like music, sound effects, voice recordings) directly into a webpage without requiring external plugins such as Flash.<br>
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;">
Example:<br>
<audio controls>
  <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="song.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
</div>
</p>

<p>
 Q62.What is the difference between progress and meter tag?<br><br>
 Ans.Both (progress) and (meter) are new HTML5 elements, but they are used for different purposes.<br><br> 

 Difference Between (progress) and (meter):-<br><br>

1.Purpose:-<br>
A.(Progress):-	Represents the completion progress of a task.<br>
B.(Meter):-	Represents a scalar measurement within a known range (like a gauge).<br><Br>

2.Meaning:-<br>
A.(Progress):-	"How much work is done out of the total."	<br>
A.(Progress):-value, max	<br>
B.(Meter):-value, min, max, low, high, optimum<Br><BR>

3.Example Use Case:-<br>
A.(Progress):-	File download progress, task completion status.<br>
B.(Meter):-	Showing temperature, disk usage, exam marks compared to max.<br>
</p>
  
<p>
 Q63.What is the use of figure tag in HTML 5?<br><Br>
 Ans.The (figure) tag in HTML5 is used to semantically group self-contained content such as images, diagrams, charts, code snippets, or illustrations, along with their captions.<Br>

It is usually paired with the (figcaption) tag, which provides a caption or description for the figure.<Br>

🔹 Why use (figure)?<Br><Br>

Helps browsers, search engines, and screen readers understand that the content is a single unit.<Br>

Keeps the caption tied to the media.<Br>

Improves semantic meaning and accessibility of a webpage.<Br>  
</p>

<p>
 Q64.What is the use of figcaption tag in HTML 5?<br><Br>
 Ans.The (figcaption) tag in HTML5 is used to provide a caption or description for the content inside a (figure) element.<bR>

It makes the media (image, chart, code, diagram, video, etc.) more meaningful and accessible by explaining what it represents.<bR><bR>

🔹 Key Points:<bR>

(figcaption) must be placed inside the (figure) element.<bR>

It can appear before or after the media.<bR>

It is optional, but when present, it provides semantic value.<bR>

Improves SEO and accessibility (screen readers announce the caption).<bR>  
</p>

<p>
 Q65.What is button tag?<bR><bR>
 Ans.The (button) tag in HTML is used to create a clickable button on a webpage.<br>

It is a form control element but can also be used outside forms for actions like opening a modal, triggering JavaScript, or navigation.<br>

🔹 Types of Buttons:-<br>

a.The type attribute defines the button’s behavior:<br>

b.type="submit" (default) → Submits a form.<br>

c.type="reset" → Resets form fields to their default values.<br>

d.type="button" → A general button (does nothing by default; usually controlled by JavaScript).<br>
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;"></div>
🔹 Example:
<!-- Submit Button -->
<button type="submit">Submit</button>

<!-- Reset Button -->
<button type="reset">Reset</button>
</div>
 
</p>

<p>
Q66.What is the use of details and summary tag?<br><br>
Ans.The (details) and (summary) tags in HTML5 are used together to create collapsible/expandable sections of content without JavaScript.<br>

🔹 (details) Tag:-<br>

Defines a container for additional information that the user can show or hide.<br>

By default, it’s hidden until expanded.<Br><bR>

🔹 (summary) Tag:-<Br>

Acts as the visible heading/label for the (details) element.<br>

Clicking it toggles the visibility of the hidden content.<br>
<div style="background-color: lightpink;">

🔹 Example:
<details>
  <summary>Read More About HTML5</summary>
  <p>HTML5 introduced many new elements like audio, video, canvas, and semantic tags such as article, section, and footer.</p>
</details>  
</div>
</p>

<p>
 Q67.What is datalist tag?<br><br>
 Ans.The (datalist) tag in HTML5 is used to provide a list of predefined options for an (input) element.<br>

It helps users by giving them auto-suggestions while typing, but they are still free to enter their own custom values.<Br><Br>

🔹 How It Works:<br>

(input) is linked to a (datalist) using the list attribute.<br>

(datalist) contains multiple (option) elements.<Br>
  <div style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;">

🔹 Example:<br>
<label for="browser">Choose your browser: </label>
<input list="browsers" name="browser" id="browser">

<datalist id="browsers">
  <option value="Google Chrome">
  <option value="Mozilla Firefox">
  <option value="Microsoft Edge">
  <option value="Safari">
  <option value="Opera">
</datalist> 
  </div>
</p>

<p>
 Q68.How are tags migrated from HTML4 to HTML5?<br><Br>
 Ans.When HTML moved from HTML4 → HTML5, some tags were retained, some were improved, and some were removed (deprecated/obsolete). New semantic tags were also introduced.<br><br>

🔹 Migration of Tags from HTML4 to HTML5<br>
(A.) Tags still supported (but improved in HTML5)<br>

div, span, p,h1–h6, table, form, input, textarea, img, a, etc.<br>

Attributes improved (e.g., input got new types like email, date, range, etc.).<br><br>

(B). New semantic tags in HTML5<br>

Structural tags: header, footer, section, article, nav, aside.<br>

Media tags: audio, video, source, track.<br>

Graphics tags: canvas, svg.<br>

Interactive tags: details, summary, dialog.<br>

Form tags: datalist, output, progress, meter.  <br>
</p>

<p>
 Q69.If I do not put (!DOCTYPE html) will HTML 5 work?<br><bR> 
 Ans.The (!DOCTYPE html) declaration is very important in HTML5.<br> <Br>
  What happens if you don’t include it?<Br>

A.The browser falls back to quirks mode or almost standards mode.<br>

B.In quirks mode, old browsers (especially Internet Explorer) render pages in a backward-compatible way (like HTML4).<Br>

C.Modern browsers will still try to parse HTML5 tags, but behavior can be inconsistent (especially with CSS box model, new form inputs, and semantic tags).<br>

D.It can lead to unexpected layout issues and reduced cross-browser compatibility.<br>
</p>

<p>
 Q70.What is the use of the required attribute in HTML5?<br><br>
 Ans.The required attribute in HTML5 is used to make a form field mandatory before submission.<br>

If a field has required, the browser will check that it is not empty. If the user tries to submit the form without filling it, the browser shows a validation error message automatically (without JavaScript).<bR>
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;">
🔹 Example:<br>
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required><br><Br>

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required><br><Br>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Q71.What are the new (input) types for form validation in HTML5?<br><br>  
Ans.HTML5 introduced several new (input) types that make form validation easier and reduce the need for JavaScript. These types automatically validate user input according to the expected format.<br><br>
🔹 New HTML5 (input) Types for Form Validation:<br>
(A).email:-	Ensures the input is a valid email address (e.g., user@example.com).<br>

(B).url:-	Ensures the input is a valid URL (e.g., https://example.com).<br>

(C).tel:-	Input for a telephone number. Some browsers provide a numeric keypad on mobile.<br>
</p>

<p>
Q72.HTML is case-sensitive or not?<br><br>
Ans.HTML is not case-sensitive. <br>

This means that tags, attributes, and attribute values can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case, and browsers will still interpret them correctly. 
</p>

<p>
Q73.When are comments used in HTML?<br><bR>
Ans.Comments in HTML are used to add notes or explanations in the code that do not appear in the browser. They are useful for developers to:<Br><Br>

🔹 Purposes of HTML Comments:-<Br>

(A).Explain code: Make your HTML easier to understand for yourself or others.<Br>

(B).Debugging: Temporarily disable sections of code without deleting them.<Br>

(C).Organize code: Mark sections or add reminders in long HTML documents.<Br>

(D).Collaboration: Provide instructions or clarifications for other developers.<Br>
</p>

<p>
Q74.What are Attributes and how do you use them?<br><br>
Ans.In HTML, attributes are used to provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements.<br>

Attributes are always written inside the opening tag of an element and usually come in a name="value" format.<br>  
</p>
<p>
Q75.What do you mean by for attributes in label tag.<br><bR>
Ans.The (for) attribute in the HTML (label) tag is used to associate the label with a specific form control (like (input), (textarea), or (select)).<br>

This improves usability and accessibility because clicking the label automatically focuses or activates the associated input.<br>

🔹 How it works:<br>

The value of the for attribute should match the id of the input element.<br>
<div style="background-color: lightsalmon;">
🔹 Example:
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username"><Br><bR>

<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email">   
</div> 
</p>
 
<p>
Q76.How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?<br><br>
Ans.To create a hyperlink in HTML, you use the <a> (anchor) tag. The hyperlink allows users to navigate to another page, a section of the same page, an email, or even download a file.<br>
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;">
🔹 Basic Syntax:<br>
<a href="https://www.google.com/">Link Text</a>
</div>


a.href: Specifies the destination URL.<br>

b.Link Text: The clickable text shown on the webpage.
</p>

<p>
Q77.Name some common lists that are used when designing a page.<br><br>
Ans.In HTML, lists are commonly used to organize content on a webpage. There are three main types of lists used in designing pages:<br><br>

🔹 1. Ordered List (ol):-<br>

>Displays items in a numbered sequence (1, 2, 3…).<br>

>Useful when the order matters, like steps in a process.<br>

Example:

<ol>
  <li>Choose a template</li>
  <li>Customize content</li>
  <li>Publish your website</li>
</ol>

🔹 2. Unordered List (ul):-<br>

>Displays items with bullets (•).<br>

>Useful for lists where order does not matter, like features or menu items.<br>

Example:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About Us</li>
  <li>Services</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>

🔹 3. Definition List (dl):-<br>

>Consists of terms and their descriptions.<br>

>Uses <dt> for the term and <dd> for the description.<br>

Example:<br>

<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language, used to create web pages.</dd>

  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets, used to style HTML elements.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>
Q78.Which attributes is required in input tag.<br><bR>
Ans.In HTML, the (input) tag has several attributes, but no attribute is strictly required for the tag to work—it will create a basic text input by default.<bR>

However, certain attributes are commonly used depending on the type of input and form requirements.  <br><br>
🔹 Commonly Used Attributes for (input):<br>
A.Type:-<br>
Specifies the type of input (text, password, email, number, etc.). Default is text.<BR><BR>

B.Name:-<br>
Name of the input; used when submitting form data to the server.  <br><Br>
 
C.Value:-<br>
Predefined value of the input field.  
</p>

<p>
Q79.What do you mean by MARKUP language and hypertext in HTML?<br><br>
Ans.Markup Language

A markup language is a system for annotating text so that a computer can understand its structure and display it properly.<br>

In HTML, we use tags (like (p), (h1), (a)) to "mark up" content.<br>

These tags tell the browser how to display the content and what it represents (heading, paragraph, link, image, etc.).<Br><br>

Example:<br>

<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>


a.(h1) marks the heading.<br>

b.(p) marks a paragraph.  
</p>

<p>
Q80.How are active links different from normal links?<br><br>
Ans.In HTML, active links and normal links differ mainly in their state and appearance. This is usually controlled using CSS pseudo-classes.<br>

1. Normal Links:-<br>

A.The default state of a hyperlink when it has not been clicked.<br>

B.Displayed using the (a) tag without any interaction.<br>

C.Usually appears as blue and underlined in most browsers (default style).<br><br>

<DIV style="background-color: lightcoral;">
Example:<br>

<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

</DIV>
This is a normal (unvisited) link.<br>

2. Active Links:-<br>

A.The state of a link while it is being clicked.<br>

B.Often changes color or style temporarily to indicate the user is interacting with it.<br>

C.Controlled in CSS using the :active pseudo-class.<Br><bR>

Example:<br>

<a href="https://www.example.com" class="link">Visit Example</a>

<style>
.link {
  color: blue; /* Normal link */
  text-decoration: none;
}
.link:active {
  color: red; /* Active link while clicking */
}
</style>
<br>


When you click the link, it turns red until the click is released.  
</p>

<P>
Q81.What happens if there is no text between the tags? Does this affect the display of the HTML file?<BR><BR>
Ans.Yes, it can affect the display, but it depends on the type of HTML tag.<br>

1. If a tag normally contains text (like p, h1, span)<br>

No text inside the tag means nothing will be displayed on the page for that element.<br>

The browser still renders the element, but it may take minimal or no visible space depending on CSS.<br>

Example:<br>

<p></p>
<h1></h1>


Nothing appears on the webpage.<br>

<p> may still create a small vertical space due to default styling.<br>

2. If a tag is self-closing or doesn’t require content (like (img) or (br))<br>

> These tags don’t need text.<br>

> Display depends on the tag itself or its attributes.<br>

Example:<br>

<img src="logo.png" alt="">
<br>


> (img) displays the image (or nothing if src is missing).<br>

> (br) adds a line break regardless of content.<br>

3. Semantic impact:-<br>

A.Leaving important tags empty can affect accessibility and SEO.<br>

B.Screen readers or search engines may ignore empty elements. <br>   
</P>

<p>
Q82.What are the limits of the text field size?<br><br>
Ans.In HTML, the text field size (created using (input type="text")) can be controlled in a few ways, but it does have some practical and attribute-based limits.<Br>

1. size Attribute:-<br>

> Determines the visible width of the input field in number of characters.<Br>

Example:

<input type="text" name="username" size="20">


The field will be wide enough to display ~20 characters.<Br>

This does not limit the actual number of characters a user can enter; it only affects the visible width.<br>

2. maxlength Attribute:-<br>

>Specifies the maximum number of characters the user can enter.<br>

Example:<br>

<input type="text" name="username" maxlength="50">


User cannot type more than 50 characters.<br>

3. CSS Control:-<br>

>You can also set the width of the text field using CSS:<Br>

<input type="text" style="width: 300px;">
<br>


This controls visual width, not character limit.  
</p>

<p>
Q83.What is the relationship between the border and rule attributes?<br><br>
Ans.In HTML, the border and rules attributes are related to tables, but they control different aspects of table borders.<br>

1. border Attribute:-<br>

Specifies whether the table has a visible border and the thickness of that border.<br>

Applies to the entire table.<br>

Example:<br>

<table border="2">
  <tr>
    <td>Cell 1</td>
    <td>Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

border="2" → table border thickness of 2 pixels.

2. rules Attribute:-<br>

Specifies which internal lines (rules) are shown inside the table between rows and columns.<br>

Only works when border is present.<br>

Possible values:<br>

none → no internal lines<br>

groups → lines between row groups and column groups<br>

rows → lines between rows<br>

cols → lines between columns<br>

all → lines between all rows and columns<br>

Example:<br>

<table border="2" rules="rows">
  <tr>
    <td>Cell 1</td>
    <td>Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cell 3</td>
    <td>Cell 4</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

rules="rows" → only horizontal lines between rows are shown.  
</p>

<p>
Q84.What is Cell Spacing and Cell Padding?<br><br>
Ans.In HTML tables, cell spacing and cell padding are used to control the space around and inside table cells, but they serve different purposes.<br>

1. Cell Spacing:-<br>

A.Definition: The space between table cells.<br>

B.Controlled by the cellspacing attribute on the (table) element.<br>

C.Creates a gap between the borders of adjacent cells.<br>

Example:<br>

<table border="1" cellspacing="10">
  <tr>
    <td>Cell 1</td>
    <td>Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

cellspacing="10" → 10 pixels of space between each cell.<br>

2. Cell Padding:-<br>

A.Definition: The space between the cell content and the cell border.<br>

B.Controlled by the cellpadding attribute on the (table) element.<br>

C.Increases inner spacing, making the content look less cramped.<br>

Example:<br>

<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td>Cell 1</td>
    <td>Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

cellpadding="10" → 10 pixels of padding inside each cell.  
</p>

<P>
Q85.What is difference between HTML and XHTML?<BR><BR>
Ans.1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language):-<br>

A.Standard markup language for creating web pages.<br>

B.Not strictly case-sensitive; tags and attributes can be uppercase, lowercase, or mixed.<br>

C.Browsers are forgiving of errors (like missing closing tags).<br>

D.HTML5 is the latest version, supports multimedia and semantic tags.<br>

Example:<br>

<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<br>
2. XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language)<br>

A.A stricter version of HTML that follows XML rules.<br>

B.Case-sensitive; all tags and attributes must be lowercase.<br>

C.All elements must be properly closed.<br>

D.Browsers are less forgiving of errors; a single mistake can break the page.<br>

Example:
<br>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<br />
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" />
    
</P>
    
<p>
Q86.How many types of CSS can be included in HTML?<br><br>
Ans.In HTML, there are three main types of CSS that can be included to style web pages:<br>

1. Inline CSS:-<br>

> Applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.<br>

> Only affects that single element.<br>

> Quick, but not recommended for large projects because it mixes content with presentation.<br>

Example:<br>

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is an inline styled paragraph.</p>

2. Internal CSS (Embedded)<br>

> Written inside a (style) tag within the (head) section of the HTML page.<br>

> Applies to all elements on that page matching the selectors.<br>

Example:<br>

<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This paragraph is styled using internal CSS.</p>
</body>
<br>
3. External CSS:-<br>

> Written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML using the (link) tag.<br>

> Best for reusing styles across multiple pages.<br>

Example (style.css):<br>

p {<br>
  color: red;<br>
  font-size: 20px;<br>
}<br>


Linking in HTML:<br>

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p>This paragraph is styled using external CSS.</p>
</body>

  
</p>
  
<p>
Q87.What are logical and physical tags in HTML?<br><br>
Ans.In HTML, logical and physical tags refer to the distinction between tags that define the meaning/structure of content versus tags that define its appearance/formatting.
<br>
1. Logical Tags:-<br>

> Define the meaning or structure of the text rather than its appearance.<br>

> Focus on semantics (what the content represents).<br>

> The browser may render them with a default style, but their main purpose is logical structure. <br> <br>

2. Physical Tags:-<br>

> Define how the text should look visually, regardless of its meaning.<br>

> Focus on presentation, not semantics.<br>

> Mostly deprecated in HTML5, replaced by CSS for styling.<br>
</p>
 
<p>
Q88.How can you apply JavaScript to a web page?<br><br>
Ans.You can apply JavaScript to a web page in three main ways: inline, internal, or external. Each method allows you to add interactivity, validation, or dynamic behavior to your HTML content.
<br>
1. Inline JavaScript:-<br>

A.Placed directly inside an HTML element using event attributes like onclick, onmouseover, etc.<br>

B.Only affects the specific element.<br>

Example:<br>

<button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click Me</button>

<br>
When the button is clicked, the browser shows an alert.

2. Internal JavaScript:-<br>

Written inside a (script) tag within the HTML file, usually in the (head) or (body).<br>

Can affect multiple elements on the page.<br>

Example:<br>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Internal JS Example</title>
  <script>
    function showMessage() {
      alert('Welcome to my website!');
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="showMessage()">Click Me</button>
</body>
</html>
<br>
3. External JavaScript:-<br>

A.Written in a separate .js file and linked using the <script src="filename.js"></script> tag.<br>

B.Best for reusability and maintaining large projects.<br>

Example (script.js):<Br>

function showMessage() {<br>
  alert('Hello from external JavaScript!');<br>
}<br>


Link in HTML:<br>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>External JS Example</title>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="showMessage()">Click Me</button>
</body>
</html>  
</p>

<p>
Q89.How to make you radio button and check-box. and how to implement this??<br><br>
Ans.1. Radio Buttons:-<br>

> Used when the user can select only one option from a group.<br>

> All radio buttons in the same group must have the same name attribute.<br>

Example:<br>

<form>
  <p>Choose your gender:</p>
  <input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male">
  <label for="male">Male</label><br>

  <input type="radio" id="female" name="gender" value="female">
  <label for="female">Female</label><br>

  <input type="radio" id="other" name="gender" value="other">
  <label for="other">Other</label><br>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form> 

2. Checkboxes:-<br>

> Used when the user can select multiple options.<br>

> Each checkbox can have the same or different name, depending on how you want to collect data.<br>

Example:<br>

<form>
  <p>Select your hobbies:</p>
  <input type="checkbox" id="reading" name="hobby" value="reading">
  <label for="reading">Reading</label><br>

  <input type="checkbox" id="traveling" name="hobby" value="traveling">
  <label for="traveling">Traveling</label><br>

  <input type="checkbox" id="gaming" name="hobby" value="gaming">
  <label for="gaming">Gaming</label><br>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
</p>

<p>
Q90.What is main reason or main advantage of label tag?<br><br>
Ans.The main reason or primary advantage of the (label) tag in HTML is improved usability and accessibility for form controls.
<br>
Key Advantages of (label):-<br>

1.Clickable association with form controls<br>

A.When a (label) is linked to an (input)(via the for attribute), clicking the label automatically focuses or activates the input.
<br>
B.This makes forms easier to use, especially on small screens or for users with motor difficulties.<br>

Example:<br>

<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">


C.Clicking “Username:” moves the cursor to the input field.<br>

2.Improved accessibility:-<br>

Screen readers use labels to describe form fields to visually impaired users.<br>

Helps users understand what input is expected.<br>

3.Better form structure:-<br>

Makes forms more semantic and easier to maintain.<br>

Avoids relying on placeholder text alone, which disappears when users type.<br>  
</p>

<p>
Q91.How will you implement when you click on submit button your whole data comes in URL form?<br><br>
Ans. 1.Use the method="GET" in the (form) tag.<br>

A.Form data is appended to the URL as query parameters.<br>

B.Each input’s name and value are included in the URL.<br>

C.Commonly used for search forms or non-sensitive data.<br>

2. Example:-<br>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>GET Form Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <form action="submit_page.html" method="GET">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br><br>

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
<br>
3. How it works:-<br>

User fills the form fields.<br>

Clicks Submit.<br>

Browser sends data to submit_page.html using the URL query string:  <br>
submit_page.html?username=John&email=john@example.com
</p>

<p>
Q92.Write a code to insert an image.<br><br>
Ans.To insert an image in HTML, you use the (img) tag. This tag is self-closing and requires at least the src attribute (image path) and usually the alt attribute (alternative text for accessibility).
<br>
Basic Syntax:<br>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
<br>
Example with Additional Attributes:-<br>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Insert Image Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>My Favorite Image</h1>

  <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo" width="200" height="150">

</body>
</html>
  
</p>

<p>
Q93.Write html code to create a 2*2 table : Table columns should be name and salary , and provide two entries for this.<br><br>
Ans.Here’s a simple HTML code to create a 2×2 table with columns Name and Salary, and two entries:<br><br>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>2x2 Table Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Employee Salary Table</h2>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Salary</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>John Doe</td>
      <td>$5000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Jane Smith</td>
      <td>$6000</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</body>
</html>  
</p>
<p>
Q94.Create radio button (MERN, MEAN : course)and checkbox(HTML, CSS, React, Node : technology) and explain the difference between these two.<br><br>
Ans.Let’s create a simple HTML form with radio buttons for courses and checkboxes for technologies, and then explain the difference.
<br>
HTML Code Example:-<br>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Radio and Checkbox Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Choose Your Course</h2>
  <form>
    <!-- Radio Buttons: Only one option can be selected -->
    <input type="radio" id="mern" name="course" value="MERN">
    <label for="mern">MERN</label><br>

    <input type="radio" id="mean" name="course" value="MEAN">
    <label for="mean">MEAN</label><br><br>

    <h2>Select Technologies You Know</h2>
    <!-- Checkboxes: Multiple options can be selected -->
    <input type="checkbox" id="html" name="technology" value="HTML">
    <label for="html">HTML</label><br>

    <input type="checkbox" id="css" name="technology" value="CSS">
    <label for="css">CSS</label><br>

    <input type="checkbox" id="react" name="technology" value="React">
    <label for="react">React</label><br>

    <input type="checkbox" id="node" name="technology" value="Node">
    <label for="node">Node</label><br><br>

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>  
</p>

<p>
Q95.Create a table and explain how to acheive colspan.<br><br>
Ans.Let’s create a table and see how to use colspan in HTML.<br>

HTML Code Example:-<br>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Colspan Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Student Scores</h2>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th colspan="2">Scores</th> <!-- This header spans 2 columns -->
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>John</td>
      <td>Math: 90</td>
      <td>Science: 85</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Jane</td>
      <td>Math: 95</td>
      <td>Science: 92</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</body>
</html>
<br>
Explanation of colspan:-<br>

colspan is an attribute used in the (td) or (th) tag.<br>

It merges multiple columns into a single cell.<br>

Syntax:<br>

(td colspan="number_of_columns")Cell Content(/td)<br>

In the example above:<br>
(th colspan="2")Scores</th><br>


The “Scores” header spans two columns (Math and Science).<br>

Without colspan, the header would occupy only one column, which would not align properly with the data below.
  
</p>

<p>
Q96.In Iframe Which attributes are more impontant?<br><br>
Ans.In HTML, the (iframe) tag is used to embed another HTML page within the current page. Some attributes are especially important because they control what page is displayed, its size, and behavior.<br><br>
  Important (iframe) Attributes:-<br>  
  A.src:-	Specifies the URL of the page to display inside the iframe. (Required)<BR>
  B.width:-	Sets the width of the iframe (in pixels or %).<BR>
  C.height:-	Sets the height of the iframe (in pixels or %).<BR>
  D.name:-	Gives the iframe a name so links or forms can target it.<BR>
</p>
